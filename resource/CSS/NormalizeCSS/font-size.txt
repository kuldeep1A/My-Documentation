The expression "font-size:calc(2.5rem + 3.75 * ((100vw - 48rem) / 42))" represents a CSS rule for calculating the font size of an element dynamically based on the viewport width (vw) and the value of the root em (rem) unit.

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. "2.5rem" represents a base font size of 2.5 times the root em unit. The rem unit is relative to the font size of the root element of the document (usually the `<html>` element).

2. "(100vw - 48rem)" calculates the difference between the viewport width (100vw) and 48 times the root em unit (48rem). This calculation determines how much space is available in the viewport for the dynamic font size.

3. "((100vw - 48rem) / 42)" divides the previously calculated difference by 42. The number 42 here represents a scaling factor, indicating how much the font size should change in relation to the available space in the viewport.

4. Finally, "3.75 * ((100vw - 48rem) / 42)" multiplies the result of the previous step by 3.75. This multiplication further scales the font size based on the available space.

Adding the base font size from step 1, the final result of the entire expression is the calculated font size for the element.

In summary, this CSS rule dynamically adjusts the font size based on the viewport width, taking into account a base font size and scaling it depending on the available space in the viewport. The specific values used (2.5, 3.75, 48, and 42) can be adjusted to achieve the desired font size scaling behavior.
